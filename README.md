# Simple Command Line Calculator

Developed a simple command line calculator using [TypeScipt](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer).

Alos created a NPX command for this project and published it on npm.

Run the following command to experience my CLI calculator:
```
npx calculator_anwar
```
